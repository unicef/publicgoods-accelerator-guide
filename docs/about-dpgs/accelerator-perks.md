# Accelerator Perks of Supporting Start-Ups to Create Digital Public Goods

When a startup creates a DPGs, opportunities for scaling startups open. You want your start-ups to be successful, below are the reasons your startups should create DPGs:

1. **Access to a Global Network:** Solutions that are recognized as a DPG will be made discoverable to a global community including  governments, technical providers, NGOs, donors, and multilaterals who are interested in supporting DPGs. This also can include lead to increased discoverability by technical contributors which is important for active open source solutions. The DPG that your accelerator supports could be considered or included in recommendations made to various stakeholders seeking open source solutions that have been recognized as DPGs. Additionally, startups can access a global network of other DPG product owners & contributors. 

2. **Potential Scale and Growth of the Startup Participating in your Programme:** The startups you support in your accelerator program can potentially be adapted to solve challenges in other countries, providing it opportunity to scale and growth quicker in new regions than a proprietary solution. One of the most notable examples where this has been seen before is DHIS2, an open source, web-based platform most commonly used as a health management information system (HMIS). Today, DHIS2 is the world’s largest HMIS platform, in use by 73 low and middle-income countries.

3. **Branding & Credibility:** If the startup's solution meets the DPG Standard, it will be officially considered a DPG, demonstrating that it is in accordance with global standards. Once a solution is recognized as a DPG, your work as an accelerator and the DPG itself is made visible to a global audience including governments, NGOs, and non-profit organizations. The DPGA is endorsed by the [UN Secretary General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/), and the DPG Registry aspires to become a global go-to-platform for open source solutions. 

4. **Potential Funding and Support for the Startup:** As the benefits of open source grows globally, there is an increased interest in supporting open source solutions. This is resulting in funding opportunities that are prioritizing open source solutions. Additionally, the DPGA is actively developing partnerships with organisations and advocating for investors to provide financial and technical assistance for DPGs.
