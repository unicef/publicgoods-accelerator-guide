# UNICEF's work

## UNICEF Office of Innovation

UNICEF’s Office of Innovation uses technology to address the biggest challenges facing children today. We use technology and new approaches to do three things:
1. **Provide Life-saving Info and Services** - We use new approaches and technologies to increase access to essential services, use scarce resources more efficiently, and communicate life-saving information.
2. **Engage Young People in Change** - We use technology and new approaches to engage young people around the world, connect them to their governments as well as opportunities to ensure that they are future ready.
3. **Help UNICEF meet children's needs today and tomorrow** - We identify emerging technologies, conduct research, experiment with new approaches, and invest in early stage solutions. We work to ensure that children can take advantage of technological opportunities and be protected from technological risks.

_**Partnerships**_
 UNICEF works to create new partnership structures that can narrow the gap between technologies (and practices) and the people we need to reach. Our partners apply their expertise, networks, internal platforms and data – not only to delivering viable business strategies, but also to creating long-term value for entire populations, systems and countries. UNICEF Innovation focuses on four types of partnerships:
1. **Startup companies:** identifying and investing in promising startups working on open source frontier technology solutions that show potential to positively impact the lives of the most vulnerable children. This is our primary work done through the UNICEF Venture Fund. We are also in collaboration with Startup Accelerators who wish to accelerate digital public goods.
2. **Private sector:** convening corporations (such as Arm, Amadeus, Google, Facebook, Telefonica, IBM, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), designers, entrepreneurs, and other development partners around the intersection of high-growth tech industries and social good.
3. **Academic:** bringing shared value through the exchange of ideas, joint capacity building and opportunities for applied research. These relationships are about building up a community of practice and practitioners and connecting with a new generation of problem solvers.
4. **International agencies and other United Nations entities:** serving as a convening force across the United Nations system and among international organizations, co-creating and implementing solutions and leveraging local and global networks.

### UNICEF's Venture Fund
One of the key vehicles for UNICEF’s Office of Innovation to meet the complex and interconnected demands and explore the space of emerging solutions is *the UNICEF Venture Fund*. The Venture Fund’s *investment-style funding targets early-stage, Open Source technology solutions developed by startup companies registered in UNICEF’s programme countries*, that address the most pressing challenges faced by children and young people, building a pipeline of DPGs. It also supports UNICEF’s Country Offices to develop and pilot Open Source frontier technology solutions.

The Venture Fund specifically looks to learn about and grow frontier technology solutions (such as drones and UAVs, blockchain, data science and artificial intelligence, and extended reality) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1+ billion persons’ needs.

### UNICEF'S CryptoFund
A prototype fund that accepts donations and make disbursements in cryptocurrencies (exclusively) to finance early stage, open source technology benefiting society.​​ [More about the UNICEF's CryptoFund found here.](https://cryptofund.unicef.io/) 


## **UNICEF and the DPGA**
UNICEF is a proud co-lead of the UN Secretary General’s The Age of Digital Interdependence recommendations around universal connectivity (1A) and digital public goods (1B). UNICEF co-founded the Digital Public Goods Alliance as a result of recommendation 1B’s call for a “broad multi-stakeholder alliance, involving the UN, to create a platform for sharing digital public goods”. This work aims to make open source solutions more accessible to governments and to help them scale. UNICEF and other DPGA partners are working directly with national governments, UN agencies, and others who are looking for open source solutions to deploy in their countries. UNICEF is also part of the governance board which functions as a strategic decision-making and oversight body for the DPGA Secretariat, and consists of member-organizations who demonstrate a strong commitment to digital public goods and are committed to supporting the DPGA’s mission and mandate.

### **UNICEF’s Pathfinder Pilots**

As a member of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), UNICEF’s Office of Innovation is committed to creating a strong ecosystem for digital public goods. Since 2021, UNICEF's Office of Innovation has led a series of DPG pathfinding pilots across 10 UNICEF Country Offices (The Eastern Caribbean, Ghana, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Niger, Philippines, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Sierra Leone, and Vietnam). Pathfinding pilots are time-bound initiatives, led by DPGA members in direct cooperation with, or with the endorsement of, a relevant government entity to build local capacity for the creation of new DPGs and/or to support the local adaptation or implementation for existing DPGs. Pathfinding pilots are tailored to the needs of a country and/or region and help define use cases, identify needs, inform adaptations, and enable policy frameworks. UNICEF’s pathfinding pilots show leadership in developing, scaling, and investing in DPGs with a commitment to highlight and share these experiences with other countries and the broader DPGA. Pathfinder pilots receive significant and valuable support from UNICEF's Digital Centre of Excellence ICT4D Advisors.
