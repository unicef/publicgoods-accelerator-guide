# How can open source businesses make money?

## Before considering if it is a Digital Public Good (DPG), we have to understand, what is considered open source?

A Digital Public Good (DPG) must meet the standard indicator of operating on an open source license, therefore the startup or a part of the business model must be open source. We will go in depth about the technicalities of open source in this guide. On a high level, here’s what you need to know.

**Open source is a way to license software, hardware, and content in a way that allows them to be continuously improved, modified and redistributed by any purpose commercially.**  Some companies see open source as marketing, as a community, free organic marketing - adoption mechanism.

### **Open source is also…**

**Method** | **Movement** |**Culture**
----------|--------------|------------
To develop and distribute software and a set of best practices to make software and build teams that make software | Movement based on ideals and philosophy beyond only code | Collection of people, values, and ideas that take the form of software projects and communities 

### What are the challenges that startups typically face?
- **Cost:** Many startup struggle to develop sustainable cost structure.  Market competitiveness now requires significant investment in R&D, testing, and product development, which includes surveying, research, coding and more, all of which many companies have minimal budgets for. 
- **Funding:** Especially in developing and emerging market, it is often difficult to gain access to seed funding and risk financing. 
- **Copyright:**  It is becoming increasingly difficult to protect IP, so businesses that create and capture their entirely from a proprietary product are being threatened by competition. 
- **Diversity:** More companies are discovering the importance of having diverse teams, which can add a rich range of perspectives that can widen a company's reach and enrich successful product development.  As such, companies with very homogenous teams are falling behind.

### What are some myths and misconceptions that exist surrounding open source?

**Myth #1:** I've heard that it's **impossible to make money in open source** because anyone can just take your code and market it themselves | **Myth #2:**  I've heard that **open source software is susceptible to feeling disjointed** because there so many people with different coding style working on the project. | **Myth #3:** I've encountered so many OS repositories that don't seem to be actively maintained.  Is it true that the **majority of open source projects are abandoned?*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_**Truth:**_ Despite the fact that your code or hardware design is freely available, there are a number of businesses that are profitable, have received investment, and have been acquired and gone public with open source solutions. | _**Truth:**_ It's true that disjointed software can happen, and that it can set a project back or even run it into the ground.  However, following coding best practices and ensuring extensive documentation surrounding project and coding guidelines and protocols can, along with good project communication and a common, well-articulated vision, help to ensure that the software remains a unified project. | _**Truth:**_ Approximately 98% are only modified in the year after they are created and are never touched again.  However, this may be tempered by the fact that about 1/2 of the active projects have only one contributor and close to 90% have 5 or fewer.  This indicates many projects are non-professional in nature.

_**How do you continue to make OS projects sustainable:**_
- Make sure developers use the product, so they have stake in making it better 
- Have a clearly defined vision that everyone can agree on 
- Get enough people onto the project such that no one developer is overwhelmed with feature requests or bugs, but not too many people such that it is hard to juggle the contributors and stick to a singular vision.
