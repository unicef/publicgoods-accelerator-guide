It seeks to cover all the crucial steps from scoping the initiative with public and private partners to graduating DPGs, providing tools and templates that can be tailored to meet unique needs.  It is a living document meant to be updated through public input as more organizations accelerate DPGs. You can participate in its continued development by suggesting changes at https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-accelerator-guide.
