# UNICEF's Work

## UNICEF Office of Innovation

UNICEF’s Office of Innovation uses technology to address the biggest challenges facing children today. We use technology and new approaches to do three things:
1. **Provide Life-saving Info and Services** - We use new approaches and technologies to increase access to essential services, use scarce resources more efficiently, and communicate life-saving information.  
2. **Engage Young People in Change** - We use technology and new approaches to engage young people around the world, connect them to their governments as well as opportunities to ensure that they are future ready. 
3. **Help UNICEF meet children's needs today and tomorrow** - We identify emerging technologies, conduct research, experiment with new approaches, and invest in early stage solutions. We work to ensure that children can take advantage of technological opportunities and be protected from technological risks. 

_**Partnerships**_
UNICEF works to create new partnership structures that can narrow the gap between technologies (and practices) and the people we need to reach. Our partners apply their expertise, networks, internal platforms and data – not only to delivering viable business strategies, but also to creating long-term value for entire populations, systems and countries. UNICEF Innovation focuses on four types of partnerships: 
1. **Startup companies:** identifying and investing in promising startups working on open-source frontier technology solutions that show potential to positively impact the lives of the most vulnerable children.  This is our primary work done through the UNICEF Innovation Fund.  We are also in collaboration with Startup Accelerators who wish to accelerate Digital Public Goods – more on that in this guide! 
2. **Private sector:** convening corporations (such as Arm, Amadeus, Google, Facebook, Telefonica, IBM, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), designers, entrepreneurs, and other development partners around the intersection of high-growth tech industries and social good.  
3. **Academic:** bringing shared value through the exchange of ideas, joint capacity building and opportunities for applied research. These relationships are about building up a community of practice and practitioners and connecting with a new generation of problem solvers. 
4. **International agencies and other United Nations entities:** serving as a convening force across the United Nations system and among international organizations, co-creating and implementing solutions and leveraging local and global networks.

### UNICEF's Venture Fund
UNICEF’s Venture Fund falls under the UNICEF Office of Innovation (OOI), launched in 2016, the Venture Fund collaborates with innovators on the ground in UNICEF programme countries to build and test new solutions at the pace required to keep up with the rapidly evolving challenges facing children.   The Venture Fund quickly assesses, funds, and grows open-source digital public goods that have been developed in new and emerging markets. The Innovation Fund invests exclusively in open source technology solutions. The investments can go either to UNICEF Country Offices or to private sector companies in UNICEF programme countries. Through its investments, the Innovation Fund is generating value by strengthening communities of problem solvers, increasing the pool of global digital public goods, and growing solutions that bring results for children and the world.  By providing flexible funding to early-stage innovators, it allows UNICEF to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source technology solutions that show potential to positively impact the lives of vulnerable children.  For more information visit: [unicefinnovationfund.org](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/).

In 2018, the Fund selected cohorts of companies working on data science and artificial intelligence, [blockchain](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicefs-innovation-fund-announces-first-cohort-blockchain-investments-emerging) and XR. These cohorts are working on similar underlying technology stacks and are collaborating across individual products to build platforms that can more easily be brought to scale.


### UNICEF'S CryptoFund
A prototype fund that accepts donations and make disbursements in cryptocurrencies (exclusively) to finance early stage, open source technology benefiting society.​​  [More about the UNICEF's CryptoFund found here.](https://cryptofund.unicef.io/) 


## **UNICEF's DPG Team**
This core team sits under UNICEF's Venture Team.  The DPG team liases closely with the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) on the pathfinders.

As a member of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), UNICEF’s Office of Innovation is committed to creating a strong ecosystem for digital public goods.  Since 2021, UNICEF's Office of Innovation has led a series of DPG pathfinding pilots across 10 UNICEF Country Offices (The Eastern Caribbean, Ghana, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Niger, Philippines, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Sierra Leone, and Vietnam). Pathfinding pilots are time-bound initiatives, led by DPGA members in direct cooperation with, or with the endorsement of, a relevant government entity to build local capacity for the creation of new DPGs and/or to support the local adaptation or implementation for existing DPGs. Pathfinding pilots are tailored to the needs of a country and/or region and help define use cases, identify needs, inform adaptations, and enable policy frameworks. UNICEF’s pathfinding pilots show leadership in developing, scaling, and investing in DPGs with a commitment to highlight and share these experiences with other countries and the broader DPGA.  Pathfinder pilots receive significatant and valuable support from UNICEF's Digital Centre of Excellence ICT4D Advisors.

## **Giga**
[Giga](https://gigaconnect.org/), an initiative launched by UNICEF and ITU in September 2019 to connect every school to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice, is supporting the immediate response to COVID19, as well as looking at how connectivity can create stronger infrastructures of hope and opportunity in the "time after COVID." 

## **Digital Public Goods Alliance**
The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.  UNICEF is a proud co-lead of the UN Secretary General’s The Age of Digital Interdependence recommendations around universal connectivity (1A) and digital public goods (1B).

### **Governing Body**
The DPGA is governed by a board which functions as a strategic decision-making and oversight body for the DPGA Secretariat. The board consists of member-organisations who demonstrate a strong commitment to digital public goods and are committed to supporting the DPGA’s mission and mandate. The current member organisations of the board are: German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), iSPIRT, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), Sierra Leone Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI), UNDP, and UNICEF. Day to day functions are steered by the DPGA Secretariat, which is co-hosted by Norad, UNDP, and UNICEF.

## **UNICEF's Digital Centre of Excellence**
UNICEF's global Digital Centre of Excellence accelerates the delivery of programme outcomes through scaling digital solutions with a dedicated centre of expertise.  The Digital Centre of Excellence serves as a bridge between Regional and Country Offices and Headquarters, providing leadership to support field digital transformation and digital technologies, including Digital Public Goods. Its proximity to programmes enables working closely with partners in demand management and delivery of innovative technology-enabled solutions for better outcomes for children
