In 2017, Kazakhstan joined the global digitalization movement with the launch of the Digital Kazakhstan strategic program. Kazakhstan Government, through is Digital Program  intends to create the needed infrastructure, talent, and ecosystem to promote digitalization of the economy. Implementing digital solutions to digitalize government and business are key to its success. Also, transforming IT sector to become a net exporter, by positioning the Kazakhstan technology ecosystem in the world will be a game changer.The program is aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the Kazakhstani economy and improving the quality of life through the progressive development of the digital ecosystem in the country. The 5 priority areas for the implementation of the program include: digitalization of the economy, proactive digital government, development of digital infrastructure, development of a creative society and the development of human capital, creation of an innovation ecosystem. The digital government agenda aims to improve the efficiency and accessibility of government services. This entails transforming the policy making process through data analysis and technology (using open / big data for predictive analytics); new ways of involving citizens (principles of open government, including open legislation, open budget, etc.); digitalization of public service delivery (paperless and digital services by default, integrated information systems); and the smart cities initiative.
Kazakhstan aims to benefit both from existing DPGs to accelerate the digitalization of the economy and by using or creating its own DPGs and position them for other countries. Digital Public Goods can be leveraged for Kazakhstan and multiple countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p></li><li><p>Last year launched, Digital Education Lab hosted an acceleration program. There were 38 startups with support of Astana Hub, whereby 4 of them were selected for seed funding, and 2 of them were selected to move forward with their DPG nomination.  </p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conducted-a-dpg-needs-assessment-unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub">Conducted a DPG needs assessment‚Äì UNICEF Kazakhstan &amp; Astana Hub<a class="hash-link" href="#conducted-a-dpg-needs-assessment-unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>UNICEF Kazakhstan conducted DPG needs assessment in Kazakhstan  in identifying gaps and needs that can be solved with Digital Public Goods (DPGs), identifying which solutions are already in place or be developed and placed as DPG, curating a database of information that can be leveraged to close the gaps. We also analyzed how the existing DPGs in Kazakhstan can be scaled to grow to other countries and be used more widely. Additionally, we analyzed government capabilities to create, adopt, procure, and maintain open-source software for government.
The main outcomes of the needs assessment will reflected in  joint plans with relevant ministries for 2022 after the validation of the reserch at Giga steering committee level this year. The main observations are grouped by the main prority areas of the needs assessment as follows:
Digital economy and transformation
To increase online co-creation platforms for innovation
Accessibility and inclusion of people with special needs
Improve the mechanism of interaction between NGOs, the private sector and the Government, since PPP partnerships are not always effective as it takes a long time to increase the number of digital products in this area
Employment Opportunities and Skills
Improving internet access in rural areas will reduce digital literacy inequalities
Digital health services for children, adolescents and youth
In general, this area is well developed from the point of view of the DPGs for providing access to digital health services, however, there are practically no DPGs for monitoring the health status of children with chronic diseases, including cancer; as the  best practice, there should be an  online tools that help children communicate with peers in similar conditions, help them develop emotional and mental resilience, help them manage their lifestyle.
Education, early childhood development and school readiness
The Ministry of Education develops educational policy centrally at the national level, after which all functions for the selection of educational platforms and decisions are transferred to the jurisdiction of local executive bodies. Local executive bodies enter into contracts with private companies. It is recommended that a nationwide e-learning platform should be created and or other online platforms needs to be aligned with generally established national and international DPG standards.
The mechanism of interaction within the framework of a PPP is time-consuming and an exit strategy must be developed in the event of the end of the PPP
Children&#x27;s online safety
In general, there is some degree of control and monitoring of online content, whitelisting and blacklisting at the level of large service providers for 18+ content, however this area is not in the field of view of public stakeholders and NGOs and among others is a less developed area. Requires the development of regulations governing the area of responsibility and regulations
There is an urgent need for digital tools to raise awareness about children&#x27;s safety on the Internet. Filters and access control tools are missing. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="funding-allocation--unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub">Funding Allocation ‚Äì UNICEF Kazakhstan &amp; Astana Hub<a class="hash-link" href="#funding-allocation--unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li><p>Incentivized 3000 USD per startup.

As a result, the Fund requires that each company receiving investment submits real-time data points that shows the progress of their project. This real-time data will be displayed on <a href="https://unicefinnovationfund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Innovation Fund website</a> and it allows donors and other interested parties to track the progress of the fund‚Äôs investment. It also allows other companies working in similar areas to learn from your experience in real-time and to connect with you.</p><p><strong>Now that you have submitted a data plan with your targets over the duration of the investment and how you intend on measuring success or failure, what is the source of real-time data that can be collected?</strong> Here are some of the things we consider as real-time data. </p><p>In addition, an important tool we would like to see and can assist with is designing some sort of impact, namely comparison of ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô or vs other solutions. This may require conducting on-the-ground field research to build user profiles and as a result, understand the target market. Hence, developing results and creating impact while understanding the right data parameters to measure that impact. </p><p>Each project is likely to have 3 phases, which can run simultaneously: </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="phase-1-development-phase">Phase 1: Development Phase<a class="hash-link" href="#phase-1-development-phase" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><blockquote><p>The development phase where you are developing your software, designing your hardware and/or creating a researching or creating a curriculum for your content. </p></blockquote><ul><li>If your project entails building new software, you‚Äôre likely to be developing your code. In line with the program‚Äôs open source requirement, the source code will be on a public repository. The most common public repository for software code is called GitHub.  The repository automatically collects the number of ‚Äúcommits‚Äù which shows the number of times your source code has been further developed and improved on as well as the number of people contributing to the code - and this real-time data can be pulled to the Innovation Fund dashboard. While this data cannot be used to evaluate the results of your project to your programme goals, it is however an important output indicator that shows how projects are advancing. </li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="phase-2-testing-phase">Phase 2: Testing Phase<a class="hash-link" href="#phase-2-testing-phase" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><blockquote><p>The testing phase where you prototype your solution or parts of your solution and get feedback from a sample group of users or beneficiaries.

Security:</strong> Addressing privacy and security in digital development involves careful consideration of which data are collected and how data are acquired, used, stored, and shared. </p></li><li><p><strong>Be Collaborative:</strong> Being collaborative mean sharing information, insights, strategies, and resources across projects, organizations, and sectors, leading to increased efficiency and impact.</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="pedagogy--curriculum-learnings">Pedagogy &amp;
