content and working with the Giga initiative in Kazakhstan. Including setting up the programme documentation, and tracking results and activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Astana Hub (Accelerator)</strong> - This quasi-government organization was the accelerator implementation partner which is an international technology park for IT startups with a main function to create an enabling environment for free development of Kazakh and foreign technology companies governed by the Digital Kazakhstan 2018-2025 state strategy.</p><ul><li><p>For example, 5000 startups have to bring in investment funding as the digital strategic programme objectives of Astana Hub, and UNICEF&#x27;s objective is helping startups grow from the idea to product stage with support from technological partners. </p></li><li><p>Kazakhstan positions itself as an innovation hub for the Central Asia region. In 2017, Kazakhstan joined the global digitalization movement with the launch of the Digital Kazakhstan strategic program. The Kazakhstan Government, through its Digital Program intends to create the needed infrastructure, talent, and ecosystem to promote digitalization of the economy. Implementing digital solutions to digitize government and business is key to its success. Also, transforming the IT sector to become a net exporter of technology will be a game changer. The program is aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the Kazakhstani economy and improving quality of life through the progressive development of the digital ecosystem in the country. The 5 priority areas for the implementation of the program include: digitalization of the economy, proactive digital government, development of digital infrastructure, development of a creative society and the development of human capital, creation of an innovation ecosystem. The digital government agenda aims to improve the efficiency and accessibility of government services. This entails transforming the policy making process through data analysis and technology (using open / big data for predictive analytics); new ways of involving citizens (principles of open government, including open legislation, open budget, etc.); digitalization of public service delivery (paperless and digital services by default, integrated information systems); and the smart cities initiative. Kazakhstan aims to benefit both from existing DPGs to accelerate the digitization of the economy and by using or creating its own DPGs and positioning them for other countries. Digital public goods can be leveraged for Kazakhstan and multiple countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. </p></li><li><p>Last year, Digital Education Lab hosted an acceleration program. There were 38 startups with support of Astana Hub, whereby 4 of them were selected for seed funding, and 2 of them were selected to move forward with their DPG nomination. </p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conducted-a-dpg-needs-assessment-unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub">Conducted a DPG needs assessment‚Äì UNICEF Kazakhstan &amp; Astana Hub<a class="hash-link" href="#conducted-a-dpg-needs-assessment-unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>UNICEF Kazakhstan conducted a DPG needs assessment to identify gaps that can be solved with digital public goods (DPGs), identifying which solutions are already in place or to be developed. The result was a curated database of information that can be leveraged to close these gaps.  </p><p>They also analyzed how the existing DPGs in Kazakhstan can be scaled to grow to other countries and used more widely and analyzed government capabilities to create, adopt, procure, and maintain opensource software for government. The main outcomes of the needs assessment will be reflected in joint plans with relevant ministries for 2022 after the validation of the research at the Giga steering committee level this year.  </p><p>The main observations are grouped by priority areas of the needs assessment including areas such as digital economy and transformation; accessibility and inclusion; employment opportunities and skills; digital health services; and education.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="funding-allocation--unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub">Funding Allocation ‚Äì UNICEF Kazakhstan &amp; Astana Hub<a class="hash-link" href="#funding-allocation--unicef-kazakhstan--astana-hub" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li><p>Incentivized $3000 USD per startup.

UNICEF shared the opportunity to become a DPG, unlocking the opportunity to scale their project to other countries as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Conducted a series of webinars to get to know DPGs and open source inclusive business models, which shared other startup DPG stories on how they went open source and became DPGs. They engaged Microsoft to share their experiences on making inclusive products for children. In total they plan to have 7 webinars.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="unicefs-venture-fund--startup-portfolio-experience-standalone-program">UNICEF&#x27;s Venture Fund ‚Äì startup portfolio experience (Standalone Program)‚Äã<a class="hash-link" href="#unicefs-venture-fund--startup-portfolio-experience-standalone-program" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><strong>Compiled Resources</strong></p><ol><li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10w6JiKvFbpCvXQnkyJMOgBX3WA_tT0NK/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109395478007960519704&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Needs Assessment</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy83fnRA236i4KFTJnSAwcQCSUVJiOYe-qTbkXQy8QI/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onboarding package</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EYnofqFMiwey51NbczaErQacA3aibG85/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109395478007960519704&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venture Fund Structure &amp; Technical Assistance Overview</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ol4FMSEFnNV_os21CcCPSLxwk4Cjwq-7/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109395478007960519704&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venture Fund 12 months milestones</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFMfQIKCQEGrUrZ_LwQYviBK17-41Gjb/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=109395478007960519704&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sample Startup 12 months milestones</a> </p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="structure-of-program--genu-cohort">Structure of Program ‚Äì GenU Cohort<a class="hash-link" href="#structure-of-program--genu-cohort" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The Venture Fund startup investment programme is based on milestones that the project sets at the very beginning with the portfolio manager for a duration of 12 months.
